The battle over the Waxing Moon which could grant any and all wishes — the Waxing Moon Ritual. The seven individuals seeking their wish, or Masters, are the bearers of the Ritual. The seven Heroic Spirits, or Servants, are summoned to this world by their Masters. The curtain rises on the battle between the seven Masters with their seven Servants.
